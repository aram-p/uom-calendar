The University of Manchester Publish timetable event titles include the unit code instead of the unit name (annoying).

This is a simple layer between the `.ics` file from from Publish and your calendar of choice that makes the events a little more readable.

To use, in your calendar, prepend `https://uom-calendar.vercel.app/format?=` to the active `.ics` url like this: `https://uom-calendar.vercel.app/format?=YOUR_ICS_URL.ics`

To get the original `.ics` URL go to https://timetables.manchester.ac.uk/ and press Subscribe > More.
